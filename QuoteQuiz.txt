ASP .Net Core, Web Api, Entity Framework Core, Sql Server, Angular and bootstrap were used to create this application!

As Task was quite simple I didn't complicate it with using bunch of design patterns or other concepts, 
only Generic Repository and Unit Of Work patterns were used. Application implements basic crud operations 
for two main entities: Quote and Author of quote. It allows user to play in two different modes and stores
results achieved during playing, also player can see acheievemnts of other players and compete with them.
Hope you enjoy it
